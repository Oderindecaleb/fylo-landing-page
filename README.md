### What I learned

I learn how to style PLaceholders in html using css in addition i also learnt how to apply the hover effect and also apply shadow using css

```css
.proud-of-this-css {
  box-shadow: 1px 2px 10px grey;
}

.proud-of-this:hover {
  color: blue;
}

::placeholder {
  color: white;
}
```

### Useful resources

- [W3 schools](https://www.w3schools.com) - This helped me for the implementation of css styling. I really liked this pattern and will use it going forward.
